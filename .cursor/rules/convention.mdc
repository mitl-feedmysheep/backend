# IntoTheHeaven Project Development Convention

This document defines the development conventions for the IntoTheHeaven project to maintain a consistent code style and architecture.

## 1. Architecture: Hexagonal Architecture

This project is based on Hexagonal Architecture. The roles and responsibilities of each layer are as follows.

- **`domain`**: Contains the core business logic. It must not have dependencies on any frameworks or external technologies.

  - `model`: Core domain models such as Aggregate Roots, Entities, and Value Objects (VOs).
  - `enums`: Enum types used within the domain.
  - `exception`: Custom business exceptions related to the domain.

- **`application`**: Handles user requests and orchestrates domain services to control the business flow.

  - `port.in`: Ports for requests coming from outside (Adapters) into the Application layer. Typically named as `UseCase` interfaces.
  - `port.out`: Ports for requests going from the Application layer to the outside (Adapters).
  - `service`: Service classes that implement the `UseCase` interfaces. Application-level technologies like `@Transactional` can be used here.

- **`adapter`**: Responsible for interacting with the outside world.

  - `in`: Delivers external requests to the application layer.
    - `web`: Spring MVC controllers (`@RestController`).
  - `out`: Delivers application requests to external systems (DB, API, etc.) and returns the results.
    - `persistence`: DB-related logic such as JPA Entities and Repository implementations.
    - `client`: External API clients.

- **`global`**: Common modules used throughout the project.
  - `config`: Configuration files for Spring, QueryDSL, etc.
  - `util`: Common utility classes.
  - `exception`: Global exception handlers.

### Core Architectural Principles

- **Data Consistency with ERD**: All `domain.model` classes and `adapter.out.persistence.entity` classes must be designed based on the [into-the-heaven.erd.json](mdc:into-the-heaven.erd.json) file. This ERD serves as the single source of truth for the data model, ensuring consistency between the database schema and the application code. Any changes to the data structure should be reflected in the ERD first.

- **CQS (Command and Query Separation)**: We apply CQS starting from the `application` layer. The `port.in` (UseCases) and `service` packages are separated into `command` and `query` sub-packages. This separation recognizes that commands (state changes) and queries (data retrieval) have different requirements and optimization strategies.

- **Domain Logic Placement**:

  - **Domain Model**: Logic that operates on a single domain aggregate and its internal state (e.g., calculating a member's age from their birthdate) should be placed within the domain model class itself. This follows the Information Expert principle and increases cohesion.
  - **Application Service**: Logic that coordinates between different domain models or aggregates belongs in the `application` service. The service is responsible for orchestrating complex business flows, fetching necessary data from multiple ports, and coordinating domain operations.
    - **Examples**:
      - Cross-aggregate operations (e.g., creating a gathering and automatically adding all group members as gathering participants)
      - Multi-step business processes that involve multiple domain entities
      - Transactional coordination between different domain operations
      - Complex queries that span multiple aggregates
    - **Pattern**: Application services should focus on orchestration and coordination, delegating actual business logic to domain models whenever possible.

- **DTO Conversion Principle**: The conversion between different DTO layers follows specific patterns to maintain architectural clarity and consistency.

  - **Response DTO Conversion (Query Flow)**: Application services (`UseCase`) should return pure domain models. The responsibility for converting these domain models into Response DTOs lies with the `adapter.in.web.controller`.

    - **Implementation**: The conversion logic should be encapsulated within the Response DTO class using a static `from` method.

    ```java
    // In SomeResponse.java
    public static SomeResponse from(SomeDomainObject domain) { /* ... */ }
    public static List<SomeResponse> from(List<SomeDomainObject> domains) { /* ... */ }

    // In SomeController.java
    SomeDomainObject domainObject = useCase.findSomething();
    SomeResponse response = SomeResponse.from(domainObject);
    return ResponseEntity.ok(response);
    ```

  - **Command DTO Conversion (Command Flow)**: Request DTOs from the presentation layer should be converted to Command DTOs at the controller level before passing to the application layer.

    - **Implementation**: Command DTOs should provide a static `from` method to convert from Request DTOs. This pattern replaces the builder pattern for Command DTOs to ensure consistent conversion logic.

    ```java
    // In SomeCommand.java
    public static SomeCommand from(SomeRequest request) {
        return new SomeCommand(
            request.getField1(),
            request.getField2()
        );
    }

    // In SomeController.java
    public ResponseEntity<SomeResponse> createSomething(@RequestBody @Valid SomeRequest request) {
        SomeCommand command = SomeCommand.from(request);
        SomeDomainObject result = useCase.executeSomething(command);
        return ResponseEntity.ok(SomeResponse.from(result));
    }
    ```

### Value Object ID (Domain ID) Handling

To enhance type safety and clarify domain intent, the application core must use Value Object IDs (e.g., `GatheringId`) instead of primitive types (`UUID`). The conversion between these types is strictly managed at the architecture's boundaries.

- **Principle**: Conversion happens at the boundaries. The application core remains pure, exclusively handling domain-specific ID objects.

- **ID Generation Strategy**: All entity IDs are generated at the **application layer** using `UUID.randomUUID()` and wrapped in domain-specific ID objects. JPA entities do **NOT** use `@GeneratedValue` annotations.

  ```java
  // In MemberCommandService.java
  Member member = Member.builder()
      .id(MemberId.from(UUID.randomUUID())) // Domain layer ID generation
      .name(command.getName())
      // ... other fields
      .build();
  ```

- **BaseEntity Configuration**: The [BaseEntity](mdc:src/main/java/mitl/IntoTheHeaven/global/common/BaseEntity.java) class must **NOT** use `@GeneratedValue` to maintain control over ID generation in the application layer. UUIDs are stored as `CHAR(36)` for readable string representation.

  ```java
  // In BaseEntity.java
  @Id
  @Column(columnDefinition = "CHAR(36)")
  @JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.CHAR)
  private UUID id; // No @GeneratedValue annotation
  ```

- **Inbound Flow (`Adapter In`)**: The `Controller` is responsible for **wrapping** primitive types received from external requests (e.g., `UUID` from `@PathVariable`) into Value Object IDs before passing them to the `UseCase`.

  ```java
  // In SomeController.java
  public ResponseEntity<SomeResponse> getSomething(@PathVariable UUID id) {
      // Wrap primitive UUID into a domain-specific ID
      SomeDomainObject domainObject = useCase.findSomething(new SomeId(id));
      // ...
  }
  ```

- **Outbound Flow (`Adapter Out`)**: The `Persistence Adapter` is responsible for **unwrapping** the primitive value from the Value Object ID before interacting with external infrastructure like a database.
  ```java
  // In SomePersistenceAdapter.java
  public Optional<SomeDomainObject> findById(SomeId domainId) {
      // Unwrap the primitive value for the repository
      UUID rawId = domainId.getValue();
      return someJpaRepository.findById(rawId).map(mapper::toDomain);
  }
  ```

## 2. Package Structure

The package structure is organized based on the hexagonal architecture layers and CQS pattern.

```

## 3. Naming Convention

- **UseCase (In-Port)**: `[Domain]QueryUseCase`, `[Domain]CommandUseCase`
  - _Example_: `MemberQueryUseCase`, `MemberCommandUseCase`
- **Service (UseCase Impl)**: `[Domain]QueryService`, `[Domain]CommandService`
  - _Example_: `MemberQueryService`, `MemberCommandService`
- **Port (Out-Port)**: `[Domain]Port`
  - _Example_: `MemberPort`
- **Adapter (Out-Adapter)**: `[Domain]PersistenceAdapter`
  - _Example_: `MemberPersistenceAdapter`
- **Controller**: `[Domain]Controller`
  - _Example_: `MemberController`
- **Request/Response DTO**: `[Action][Domain]Request`, `[Action][Domain]Response`
  - _Example_: `SignUpRequest`, `FindMemberResponse`
- **Command/Query DTO**: `[Action]Command`, `[Data]Query`
  - _Example_: `SignUpCommand`, `CreateGatheringCommand`
  - _Note_: Command DTOs should provide a static `from()` method for conversion from Request DTOs instead of using the builder pattern
- **JPA Entity**: `[Domain]JpaEntity`
  - _Example_: `MemberJpaEntity`
- **Mapper**: `[Domain]PersistenceMapper`
  - _Example_: `MemberPersistenceMapper`

## 4. API Design Principles (RESTful)

- **URI**: Resources should be represented by nouns (plural). (`/members`, `/groups/{groupId}/gatherings`)
- **HTTP Method**: Actions on resources are expressed by HTTP Methods.
  - `POST`: Create a resource.
  - `GET`: Retrieve a resource.
  - `PUT` / `PATCH`: Update a resource (full/partial).
  - `DELETE`: Delete a resource.
- **Response Format**: Use JSON as the default, with `camelCase` for keys.
- **Success Responses**: `200 OK`, `201 Created`, `204 No Content`
- **Error Responses**: `400 Bad Request`, `401 Unauthorized`, `403 Forbidden`, `404 Not Found`, `500 Internal Server Error`

## 5. Commit Message Convention

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification with detailed format.

- **Format**:

  ```
  type: {summary}
  - {element}
  - {element}
  - ...
  ```

- **`type`**:

  - `feat`: A new feature
  - `fix`: A bug fix
  - `docs`: Documentation only changes
  - `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  - `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

- **Example**:

  ```
  fix: resolve JWT authentication issues
  - Update JwtTokenProvider to use memberId as principal
  - Add Bearer token prefix handling in JwtAuthenticationFilter
  - Fix null memberId issue in @AuthenticationPrincipal
  ```

- **Assistant Guidelines**: When asked to write commit messages, always use the detailed format above with summary and bullet points listing specific changes.

## 6. Code Style

- **Lombok**: Actively use annotations like `@Getter`, `@Builder`, `@RequiredArgsConstructor` to minimize boilerplate code.
- **Immutability**: Design DTOs and Value Objects to be immutable where possible.
- **Validation**: Perform primary validation at the Controller DTO level using `@Valid`. Use specific validation annotations like `@Pattern`, `@Email`, `@NotBlank`, `@NotNull` for comprehensive input validation.
- **Exception Handling**: Define business exceptions in the `domain` or `application` layer and handle them globally using `@RestControllerAdvice`.
- **Error Messages**: All error messages thrown in exceptions must be written in English. This ensures consistency for developers and simplifies integration with logging and monitoring systems.
- **Comments**: All comments in the code must be written in English for consistency and maintainability.

## 7. Database and Performance Optimizations

### UUID Storage Configuration

- **Storage Format**: All UUIDs are stored as `CHAR(36)` for readable string representation and easier database debugging.
  - **Benefits**: Human-readable format, easier debugging, direct UUID string usage in queries
  - **Implementation**: Use `@Column(columnDefinition = "CHAR(36)")` and `@JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.CHAR)` annotations

```java
// In BaseEntity.java
@Id
@Column(columnDefinition = "CHAR(36)")
@JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.CHAR)
private UUID id;
```

- **Database Queries**: When manually querying the database, use UUID strings directly:
  - Example: `SELECT * FROM member WHERE id = '309e73a3-6d2c-456a-a3e6-59e692b7d8f7'`

### Database Configuration

- **Auto-Creation**: Use `createDatabaseIfNotExist=true` in database URL to automatically create database if it doesn't exist
- **Schema Management**: Rely on JPA DDL auto-generation (`spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto`) instead of manual schema.sql files for better compatibility between development and testing environments
- **Test Environment**: Configure test environments with `spring.sql.init.mode=never` to use JPA DDL only

## 8. Key Implementation Patterns and Conventions

This section covers specific patterns and conventions adopted in the project to address common challenges.

### a. Data Fetching and N+1 Problem

To prevent the N+1 query problem, we use JPA's EntityGraph feature for eager fetching of related entities in a single query (Fetch Join).

- **Primary Method**: Use `@EntityGraph` directly on repository methods. While powerful, be aware of its limitations.
  - **Example**: In `MemberJpaRepository`, `findWithGroupsById` uses `@EntityGraph` to fetch `groupMembers` and their associated `group` in one go.
  ```java
  // In MemberJpaRepository.java
  @EntityGraph(attributePaths = {"groupMembers", "groupMembers.group"})
  Optional<MemberJpaEntity> findWithGroupsById(UUID memberId);
  ```
- **Convention**:
  - For simple, one-off fetch joins, using `@EntityGraph` is acceptable for its simplicity.
  - For complex, dynamic, or frequently reused queries, consider using QueryDSL to ensure type safety and maintainability. The project is already configured for QueryDSL.
  - Raw JPQL queries (`@Query`) should be avoided in favor of JPA's method name conventions or QueryDSL. This enhances type safety and reduces the risk of runtime errors from typos in query strings.

### b. Adapter Responsibilities and Repository Usage

An adapter's purpose is to implement a port and bridge the application layer to an external technology (like a database).

- **Principle**: An adapter is not restricted to using only the repository that matches its name. It should use whatever repositories are necessary to fulfill its port's contract in the most efficient way.
- **Example**: `GroupPersistenceAdapter` implements `GroupPort`. To fulfill the `findGroupsByMemberId` method, it uses `MemberJpaRepository`. This is the correct approach because the query starts with a `memberId`, making `Member` the logical starting point for the database query, based on the ERD.
- **Guideline**: The choice of which repository to use within an adapter should be driven by the data model (ERD) and query efficiency, not by the adapter's name.

### c. Persistence Mapper Responsibilities

Persistence Mappers serve as the crucial translation layer between domain models and JPA entities, ensuring proper data conversion and relationship management.

- **Mandatory ID Handling**: All `toEntity()` methods must explicitly set the domain ID to the entity. This is critical for proper entity persistence.

  ```java
  // REQUIRED: Always set the domain ID in toEntity methods
  public MemberJpaEntity toEntity(Member domain) {
      return MemberJpaEntity.builder()
          .id(domain.getId().getValue()) // MANDATORY: Set domain ID
          .name(domain.getName())
          // ... other fields
          .build();
  }
  ```

- **Complete Object Graph Conversion**: When converting domain aggregates to JPA entities, mappers must handle the entire object graph, including all related entities.

  - **Domain to Entity**: The `toEntity()` method should convert not only the root aggregate but also all contained domain objects (e.g., converting `GatheringMember` domain objects to `GatheringMemberJpaEntity` when converting a `Gathering`).
  - **Entity to Domain**: The `toDomain()` method should reconstruct the complete domain aggregate with all its relationships.

- **Circular Reference Prevention**: When handling complex object graphs, prevent infinite loops by carefully managing bidirectional relationships.

  ```java
  // Example: Preventing circular reference in Prayer mapping
  private Prayer toDomain(PrayerJpaEntity entity) {
      return Prayer.builder()
          .id(PrayerId.from(entity.getId()))
          .member(entity.getMember() != null ? memberPersistenceMapper.toDomain(entity.getMember()) : null)
          .gatheringMember(null) // Prevent circular reference
          .prayerRequest(entity.getPrayerRequest())
          .build();
  }
  ```

- **Relationship Mapping**: Mappers are responsible for correctly mapping domain relationships to JPA entity relationships, ensuring that cascade operations and entity references are properly established.

  ```java
  // Example: GatheringPersistenceMapper
  public GatheringJpaEntity toEntity(Gathering gathering) {
      return GatheringJpaEntity.builder()
          .id(gathering.getId().getValue()) // MANDATORY: Set domain ID
          .name(gathering.getName())
          // Convert all GatheringMember domain objects to entities in a separated method each
          .gatheringMembers(gathering.getGatheringMembers().stream()
              .map(this::toGatheringMemberEntity)
              .collect(Collectors.toList()))
          .build();
  }
  ```

- **Cross-Domain Data Requirements**: When domain objects require data from multiple aggregates, mappers should coordinate the necessary information without violating domain boundaries.

  - Mappers may need to work with multiple repository types to gather all required data for complete domain reconstruction.
  - The mapper should ensure that domain objects receive all necessary related information while maintaining proper encapsulation.

- **Null Safety**: All mapper methods should handle null inputs gracefully to prevent NullPointerExceptions.
  ```java
  public MemberJpaEntity toEntity(Member domain) {
      if (domain == null) {
          return null;
      }
      // ... mapping logic
  }
  ```

### d. JPA Entity Design Conventions

To ensure consistency, maintainability, and alignment with our architecture, all JPA Entity classes must adhere to the following design conventions:

- **Base Entity Inheritance**: All entities must extend the common [BaseEntity](mdc:src/main/java/mitl/IntoTheHeaven/global/common/BaseEntity.java) class. This centralizes common fields like `id`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, and `deletedAt`, reducing code duplication and ensuring a consistent structure across all tables.

- **Application-Level ID Management**: JPA entities must **NOT** use `@GeneratedValue` annotations. ID generation is handled at the application layer to maintain control over the domain model lifecycle.

      ```java

  // CORRECT: BaseEntity without @GeneratedValue
  @Id
  @Column(columnDefinition = "CHAR(36)")
  @JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.CHAR)
  private UUID id; // No @GeneratedValue

  // INCORRECT: Do not use @GeneratedValue
  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.UUID) // ❌ FORBIDDEN
  private UUID id;

  ```

  ```

- **Builder Pattern for Instantiation**: Entities should be instantiated using the Builder pattern. For entities in an inheritance hierarchy (i.e., all entities extending `BaseEntity`), **`@SuperBuilder`** must be used.

  - **Usage**: The `@SuperBuilder` annotation should be used _without_ the `toBuilder = true` option. JPA entities are mutable and managed by the persistence context, so the `toBuilder()` pattern, which implies immutability, is not appropriate.
  - **Encapsulation**: To enforce the use of the builder, direct instantiation via constructors must be prevented. The no-argument constructor should be `protected` (`@NoArgsConstructor(access = AccessLevel.PROTECTED)`) for JPA's internal use, and an all-arguments constructor should be made `private` (`@AllArgsConstructor(access = AccessLevel.PRIVATE)`) to be used by the builder.

- **Global Soft-Delete Filter**: To ensure that queries only return active records, a global filter (like Hibernate's `@SQLRestriction`) should be applied at the entity level to automatically exclude records where `deleted_at` is not null. This simplifies application logic, as individual queries do not need to concern themselves with filtering for soft-deleted records.

- **Standard-Compliant Field Documentation**: Field descriptions should be documented using standard JavaDoc comments (`/** ... */`) rather than implementation-specific annotation properties (like `comment` in Hibernate's `@Column`). This improves code portability and ensures that documentation is independent of the underlying persistence provider.

- **ERD-Driven Relationships**: All entity relationships (`@ManyToOne`, `@OneToMany`, etc.) and column attributes (`nullable`, `length`, etc.) must accurately reflect the definitions in the project's ERD ([into-the-heaven.erd.json](mdc:into-the-heaven.erd.json)). The ERD is the single source of truth for the data model.

- **Relationship Management (`@OneToMany`)**: To maintain data integrity and simplify relationship management in `@OneToMany` associations, the following conventions are mandatory:
  - **`cascade = CascadeType.ALL`**: This option should be used to propagate all lifecycle operations (persist, merge, remove, etc.) from a parent entity to its children. This simplifies code by allowing operations on the aggregate root to automatically cascade to its members.
  - **`orphanRemoval = true`**: This must be used alongside `cascade`. It ensures that when a child entity is removed from a parent's collection, it is automatically deleted from the database. This prevents "orphaned" records and maintains data consistency.
  - **`@Builder.Default` on Collections**: When using `@(Super)Builder` on an entity, any collection fields (e.g., `List<T>`) must be initialized (e.g., `= new ArrayList<>()`) and annotated with `@Builder.Default`. This prevents the builder from setting the collection to `null`, thus avoiding potential `NullPointerExceptions`.

### e. Domain Model Design Conventions

To build a robust and expressive core domain, all domain models (`domain.model` package) must follow these conventions:

- **Immutability by Default**: All fields must be declared as `private final`. This ensures that domain objects are immutable, making their state predictable and safe for concurrent use.

- **Consistent and Safe Instantiation**

  - Explicit constructors should not be defined; rely on the builder provided by `@SuperBuilder`.

- **Minimal and Purposeful Annotations**:

  - **`@Getter`**: Use on all domain models to provide read-access to state.
  - **Prohibited Annotations**: To protect model integrity and enforce the builder pattern, the use of `@Setter`, `@Data`, `@NoArgsConstructor`, `@AllArgsConstructor`, and `@RequiredArgsConstructor` is strictly forbidden on domain models.

- **Clear Hierarchy (`DomainEntity` vs. `AggregateRoot`)**:
  - **`DomainEntity`**: Represents a standard entity that has a unique identity but is conceptually a child object within an aggregate (e.g., `Prayer`, `GatheringMember`).
  - **`AggregateRoot`**: Represents the root of an aggregate—a cluster of associated objects that are treated as a single unit for data changes. External objects should only hold references to the `AggregateRoot`. (e.g., `Member`, `Group`, `Gathering`).

### f. Request/Response DTO Validation

To ensure data integrity and provide clear feedback to API consumers, comprehensive validation must be implemented on all Request DTOs.

- **Validation Annotations**: Use appropriate validation annotations based on field requirements:

  - `@NotBlank`: For string fields that cannot be null, empty, or whitespace-only
  - `@NotNull`: For non-string fields that cannot be null
  - `@Email`: For email format validation
  - `@Pattern`: For custom regex validation (e.g., `@Pattern(regexp = "M|F")` for sex field)
  - `@Valid`: At controller level to enable validation processing

- **Controller Validation**: All controller endpoints that accept Request DTOs must use `@Valid` annotation:

  ```java
  @PostMapping("/signup")
  public ResponseEntity<SignUpResponse> signUp(@RequestBody @Valid SignUpRequest request) {
      // ...
  }
  ```

- **Error Messages**: Validation messages should be in English and provide clear guidance:
  ```java
  @NotBlank(message = "Username is required")
  @Pattern(regexp = "M|F", message = "Sex must be either M or F")
  ```

### g. API Documentation with Swagger (OpenAPI)

To ensure all APIs are clearly documented and easily testable, every `Controller` must be annotated with Swagger (OpenAPI) annotations. This practice is mandatory for maintaining a consistent and understandable API specification.

- **Controller-Level (`@Tag`)**: Every controller class must have a `@Tag` annotation. This groups all APIs within that controller under a common name in the Swagger UI.

  - `name`: A short, descriptive name for the API group (e.g., "Group", "Member").
  - `description`: A brief explanation of what the APIs in this group are for.

- **Method-Level (`@Operation`)**: Every public endpoint method within a controller must have an `@Operation` annotation. This describes the specific purpose of that API.

  - `summary`: A short, verb-first summary of the API's function (e.g., "Get My Groups", "Create New Gathering").
  - `description`: A more detailed explanation of what the API does, what it returns, and any important notes.

- **Language**: All descriptions must be written in **English**.

- **Example (`GroupController.java`)**:

  ```java
  @Tag(name = "Group", description = "APIs for Group Management")
  @RestController
  @RequestMapping("/groups")
  @RequiredArgsConstructor
  public class GroupController {

      // ... dependencies

      @Operation(summary = "Get My Groups", description = "Retrieves a list of groups the current user belongs to.")
      @GetMapping
      public ResponseEntity<List<GroupResponse>> getMyGroups(@AuthenticationPrincipal String memberId) {
          // ...
      }

      @Operation(summary = "Get Gatherings in Group", description = "Retrieves a list of gatherings within a specific group.")
      @GetMapping("/{groupId}/gatherings")
      public ResponseEntity<List<GatheringResponse>> getGatheringsInGroup(@PathVariable UUID groupId) {
          // ...
      }
  }
  ```

          // ...
      }

  }
